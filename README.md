## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository and [999msllc.pages.dev](https://999msllc.pages.dev/999msware).

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** Yes, there is always risk. Roblox does not allow exploits and using any third-party software to inject or execute scripts can violate their Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- Fast and stable script execution engine
- Built-in UI with script hub support
- Auto-updating to bypass Roblox patches
- Lightweight injector with minimal detection footprint
- LuaU & custom API support for scripts

## Installing
Download the [latest release of 999MSWare](https://github.com/999MS-LLC/999MSWare/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install 999MSWare after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run 999MSWare for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, 999MSWare is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.
